# PIC16B Project Proposal
## *Abstract*
As a group, we are planning on developing a platform that identifies mental health disorders according to symptoms provided by the patient. Our platform will help classify mental disorders and support the clinician with diagnosing the mental health disorder. Also, it may raise awareness and encourage people to seek help. We will work with a large dataset with multiple variables, which will be eventually evaluated by a machine learning algorithm.

## *Planned Deliverables*
We aim to create a machine learning application to help diagnose mental disorders. We will provide a machine learning model to develop an indicator or classifier to determine the mental health state of a person to support early detection.

Although our data domain is not clear at the moment, it could be audio, biosensor, mobile phone usage, social media, questionnaire, health record, etc, we will analyze the given data to finally make a code that shows data set of results. 

If our project leads to a "Full success", our model will be used to detect a mental disorder from several features or states of a person. In this case, since we plan to create a code for a data set, Jupyter Notebook will be an appropriate interface.

On the other hand, if we happen to come up with a "Partial success", we will be at least able to show several relationships between features; for example, how an willingness to seek help from psychologists is related to a satisfaction with life? In this case, we will deliver data analysis in code, therefore a Jupyter Notebook will be an appropriate interface.

## *Resources Required*
What resources do you need in order to complete your project? Data? Computing power? An account with a specific service?

Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. It’s also acceptable to link to a website from which you intend to scrape the data you will use (although note that high-quality scraping is a lot of work).

If you can’t find data for your original idea, that’s ok! Think of something related to your group’s interests for which you can find data.

Most projects should involve data in some way, but certain projects may not require data. Ask me if you’re not sure.

## *Tools and Skills Required*
What skills will you need? Machine learning, database management, complex visualization, something else? Do a bit of research into which Python packages accomplish the tasks you are going to need. Feel free to look ahead at what we’re going to do in the remainder of the course – you’re likely to find some of the packages you’ll need there!

## *What You Will Learn*
We believe we will learn numerous skills and techniques from our project. First, regardless of what data domain we end up using, we will learn to clean and preprocess our data. Then we need to understand and analyze our data, so we will use analytical skills using numpy, pandas, and other packages in Python. Also, we will know what to improve from our failures at multiple points throughout the project. And finally, we will make a presentation to audience to explain and introduce what we have done throughout the quarter.


## *Risks*
What are two things that could potentially stop you from achieving the full deliverable above? Maybe it turns out that the signal you thought would be present in the data just doesn’t exist? Or maybe your idea requires more computational power than is available to you? What particular risks might be applicable for your project?

## *Ethics*
When it comes to developing tools that aim to help people, it is important to consider potential biases or harms from these tools. In our case, unfortunately, some groups of people have the potential to benefit more than others from the existence of our algorithm. Our project will likely be able to diagnose people of European ancestry more than other groups of people. That is due to the fact that more data has been collected on European ancestry individuals, and therefore we can translate our findings to other populations, but the predictive power that we have on European ancestry individuals will not be the same as other individuals. When it comes to mental health, attitudes toward this subject vary among different ethnicities, cultures, and countries. Cultural teachings often influence beliefs about the origins and nature of mental illness, and shape attitudes towards the mentally ill, and that could affect patients’ readiness and willingness to seek treatment. Therefore, less information will be available about people of these cultures, which could potentially lead to a lower diagnostic accuracy among those populations. Unfortunately, that only further grows the health inequality that we already are facing. However, we aim to do our part in finding diverse sets of data while also keeping in mind the potential harms when our algorithm is used.

We believe that our project could make the world an overall better place, and that is because mental health is an important factor in our daily lives but it is mostly disregarded and an easy to use tool could potentially help people arrive at the right diagnosis, and therefore seek the right treatment. This project might help people who are unaware of their mental health to understand their mental state and to seek help. However, we recommend seeing a professional alongside using this tool due to the possible inaccuracy mentioned above.


## *Tentative Timeline*
  - #### *Week 6*: We anicipate to be able to demonstrate successful data aquisition and manipulation. 
  - #### *Week 8*: We will show some data analysis and an implemented machine learning model that works with a reasonable accuracy.
  - #### *Week 10*: We will have our high-level-performance machine learning model and our tool will be ready to use.
