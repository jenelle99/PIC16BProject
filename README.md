# PIC16B Project Proposal
## *Abstract*
In 3-4 sentences, describe what problem the project addresses, and the overall approach you will use to solve that problem.

## *Planned Deliverables*
Concisely state what you are aiming to create and what capabilities it will have. Are you making a webapp? A Python package for others to use? Code that creates a novel data set? Etc. Please consider two scenarios: - “Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan? - “Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline needed to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!

In each case, please make sure to be clear about what the interface is for your project. If you are making an app, then the interface should likely be either a local app or a webapp. If you are focusing on scientific computation or data science, then a Jupyter notebook may be an appropriate interface – talk to me if you’re not sure.

## *Resources Required*
What resources do you need in order to complete your project? Data? Computing power? An account with a specific service?

Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. It’s also acceptable to link to a website from which you intend to scrape the data you will use (although note that high-quality scraping is a lot of work).

If you can’t find data for your original idea, that’s ok! Think of something related to your group’s interests for which you can find data.

Most projects should involve data in some way, but certain projects may not require data. Ask me if you’re not sure.

## *Tools and Skills Required*
What skills will you need? Machine learning, database management, complex visualization, something else? Do a bit of research into which Python packages accomplish the tasks you are going to need. Feel free to look ahead at what we’re going to do in the remainder of the course – you’re likely to find some of the packages you’ll need there!

## *What You Will Learn*
What will you learn by completing this project? Feel free to mention particular techniques, software packages, version control, project management principles, any other learning goals you might have.

## *Risks*
What are two things that could potentially stop you from achieving the full deliverable above? Maybe it turns out that the signal you thought would be present in the data just doesn’t exist? Or maybe your idea requires more computational power than is available to you? What particular risks might be applicable for your project?

## *Ethics*
When it comes to developing tools that aim to help people, it is important to consider potential biases or harms from these tools. In our case, unfortunately, some groups of people have the potential to benefit more than others from the existence of our algorithm. Our project will likely be able to diagnose people of European ancestry more than other groups of people. That is due to the fact that more data has been collected on European ancestry individuals, and therefore we can translate our findings to other populations, but the predictive power that we have on European ancestry individuals will not be the same as other individuals. When it comes to mental health, attitudes toward this subject vary among different ethnicities, cultures, and countries. Cultural teachings often influence beliefs about the origins and nature of mental illness, and shape attitudes towards the mentally ill, and that could affect patients’ readiness and willingness to seek treatment. Therefore, less information will be available about people of these cultures, which could potentially lead to a lower diagnostic accuracy among those populations. Unfortunately, that only further grows the health inequality that we already are facing. However, we aim to do our part in finding diverse sets of data while also keeping in mind the potential harms when our algorithm is used.

We believe that our project could make the world an overall better place, and that is because mental health is an important factor in our daily lives but it is mostly disregarded and an easy to use tool could potentially help people arrive at the right diagnosis, and therefore seek the right treatment. This project might help people who are unaware of their mental health to understand their mental state and to seek help. However, we recommend seeing a professional alongside using this tool due to the possible inaccuracy mentioned above.


## *Tentative Timeline*
There will be checkpoints for the project at approximately two-week intervals. With this in mind, please describe what you expect to achieve after two, four, and six weeks. At each stage, you should have “something that works.” For example, maybe in two weeks you’ll ready to demonstrate the data acquisition pipeline, in four weeks you’ll be able to demonstrate some data analysis, and in six weeks you’ll have your full machine learning pipeline set up. Please keep in mind that you’ll be asked to present at each of these checkpoints. Showing “something that works” will usually be necessary for full credit.
